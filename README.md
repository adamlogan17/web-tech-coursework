# web-tech-coursework
This is my coursework submission for my Year 1 Web Technology module. 

Due to the coursework being a group project, I did not complete all the work myself. I have decided to omit the names of the other 4 members of this project and I have replaced where their names where mentioned with 'XXXXX'. All members of the group contributed to the powerpoint presentation, not just myself.

### How do I get started? ###
You can launch the ```code\startScreen.html``` or alternatively you can play the game using this [link](https://web-tech-coursework.netlify.app/), although this is not recommended.

### Individual Contribution ###
The work which I did myself has been highlighted in the individual report and within the individual video submission. I have uploaded a pdf version and a docx version of the weekly logs and individual report file as the gif's within this do not play on the pdf version. 

As a summary, the main section I contributed to were:
* The torch effect, in the basement 
* The fuse box game
* The colour pad
* Responsive header and footer
* Responsive design of the basement
